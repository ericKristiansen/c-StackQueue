# c-StackQueue


Simple Apothecary simulation:


A portion of a RPG game to include potions for stat buffs. This portion of the game will support only the apothecary behavior: Buy potions from the shop; Place orders for potions at "self-service" kiosks
The players will receive potions off the top of the stack, and have no selection method. The potion requests will be filed, and those potions created in a queue.
